# CPPDS-String
##Abstract
In coding, a string is a sequence of text characters. They're used for text manipulation, enclosed in quotes, and can't be changed directly in many programming languages.
In this file we demonstrate few codes making use of characters of string.

##Algorithm
Code 1: 
To take a name input and saving it in 'name' variable.

Code 2:
Finding String length
1. Read a string as input.
2. Initialize a counter to 0.
3. Begin a loop.
   - Check if the current character is not the null terminator.
   - If it's not the null terminator, increment the counter.
   - Continue this process until the null terminator is reached.
4. Display the counter value, which is the length of the string.

Code 3:
Printing reverse of string
1. Take a text input from the user.
2. Initialize a counter to zero.
3. Start a loop.
4. Check each character in the text.
5. If the character is not the end marker, increase the counter by one.
6. Repeat this process until you reach the end marker.
7. Display the value of the counter as the length of the text.
